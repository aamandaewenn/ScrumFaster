# ScrumFaster
ScrumFaster is a virtual Scrum board that combines a traditional Scrum board with graphical visualizations of progress and an easy way to create new user stories and assign points to make scrum meetings more efficient. Teams can use the software to create user stories and tasks, plan their sprints, delegate tasks to members, and track the groupâ€™s progress using graphical visualizations such as velocity graphs, burndown charts, and cumulative flow. Anyone utilizing the Scrum flavour of Agile could use this software to complete their projects.

### Installation

To run the ScrumFaster, you need to have java jdk (version 19) installed on your computer. To check if you have the right version, type "java -version" in your terminal. If it says that your current version is 19, everything is correct. If not, try deleting all other jdks on your machine and indicate the path to the right version (19) in your system variable "Path".

Once you have it installed, open the terminal and run the command: java -jar "path to the jar file" and watch the magic unveal.
